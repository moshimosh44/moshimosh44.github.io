# Hello! My name is Wesley Greer IV; I am a sophomore at Temple University majoring in Bioelectrical Engineering and minoring in Physics. I have interests in physics, medicine, politics, and space exploration! 
This GitHub repository will be the main space for my projects throughout the remainder of my undergraduate time at Temple University. Feel free to look around!
